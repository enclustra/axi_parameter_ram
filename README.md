## Description

### Architecture

The figure below shows the rough architecture of the AXI parameter RAM.

<img src="doc/architecture.png" alt="Architecture">

Generally the parameter RAM is used to share data between EPICS and an embedded processor in a controlled way.

As the name says, the parameter RAM contains a RAM block that contains parameters. For each parameter, a 32-bit wide memory cell is used. If a parameter is modified, the address of this parameter is written into a FIFO that can be read later by the embedded software. This ensures that the embedded software is notified about every parameter modified.

If the FIFO contains at least one access address, the IRQ output is set active so the embedded processor can react on changes of PVs.

So the usual flow of event is:
1. EPICS modifies a parameter in the parameter RAM
2. When EPICS modifies the parameter, the address of the parameter is stored in the FIFO
3. Because the FIFO is not empty, the embedded processor receives an IRQ
4. The embedded processor reads the access address from the RAM
5. Now the embedded processor can take any action that is required if a specific parameter changes. If the value of the paramter is required, the embedded processor reads the value from the RAM.

The parameter RAM can also be use to transfer data from the embedded processor to EPICS. In this case, the embedded processor writes to the parameter RAM. Because the embedded processor shall not trigger an IRQ to itself, it uses a mirrored address space of the RAM (see [Memory Map](#memory-map)), which does not forward addresses to the FIFO.

There is only one IRQ output, so IRQs for data transfer from embedded processor to EPICS are not possible with only one parameter RAM and usually EPICs just scans the parameters regularly. However, it would be possible to add a second parameter RAM that works in the oposite direction (generate IRQs for EPICS but not for embedded software).

### Memory Map

The figure below shows the memory map. The size of the RAM is configurable, so addresses depend on configuration. The example shows addresses for a parameter RAM with 1024 entries (=4kB RAM address space).

The first four DWORDs are mapped to registers that contains the FIFO flags (full/empty) and allow reading addresses from the FIFO. Then the RAM is mapped twice. Once with IRQ generation and once without IRQ generation.

Because the address map depends on the size of the RAM, the address offset for writing parameters without IRQ is stored in a register. This allows implementing the driver idependently of the size of the RAM because instead of knowing the RAM size, it just reads the required offset from the register.
